# 🚀 Near-Earth Asteroid 3D Visualization

Interactive 3D Visualation of near-Earth asteroid orbits using Plotly.

## 🛰️ Data Source

The near-Earth asteroid data used in this project was retrieved from the **[NASA Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) API](https://api.nasa.gov/)**.

Data includes:
- Semi-major axis
- Eccentricity
- Inclination
- Ascending node longitude
- Perihelion argument
- Orbital period
- Absolute magnitude
- Hazard status

The data was processed using Python for visualization in Plotly.

### 🔑 NASA API Key

To run the data pull scripts, you will need a **NASA API key** (free and easy to obtain):

1. Visit [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/).
2. Sign up for an API key.
3. Replace `api_key = "YOUR_KEY_HERE"` in the script with your personal key.
